        <h3>Question-1 : Since stamps require images, and they should be persisted, what is your strategy to save the
            image? Are you going to convert it into a base64 String and save the whole image it in the database OR save
            the image on the file system, and add the name to the database? Whatever is your answer, why do you
            consider this the best way to proceed?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>I choose the second option to save the image on the file system, and add the name to the database.I think it will not be a good idea to convert it into a base64 String and save the whole image it in the database. Because it makes it so much harder to access the images directly if I need to, uses more space than storing the images in the file system and prevents from storing the images on a file server separate to the database server if ever I need to.</p>

        <h3>Question-2 : Stamps have a group of attributes, so you will probably need a data structure to represent
            stamps. In PHP, that structure most likely be an associative array or an object. Give it a though and
            answer which structure are you going to use and why?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>I have used the associative array data structure to represent the stamps.I find it clear and much more easier to display all data from the databse with the array key. Also I think it is faster to use an associative array than using an object when working with data from the database.</p>
        <h3>Question-3 : If you choose to treat your stamps as objects, how are you going to save the object in the
            database? Are you planning to save each attribute to a different column manually or use an ORM system?
            Explain your answers on detail.</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>I didn't choose to treat my stamps as objects. I choose associative array data structure to save the data.</p>
        <h3>Question-4 : When saving passwords on the database, plain text is not an option. What is your strategy to
            store the user password? Are you going to encrypt or hash the password? No matter what your answer is,
            explain why and what algorithm do you plan to use.</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>I am going to hash the password because it can not be decrypted so that hackers can not hack the password.</p>
