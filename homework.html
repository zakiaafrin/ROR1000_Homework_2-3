        <h3>Question-1 : What lessons did you learn doing the project?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>I have learned about session, connection to database, insert and update data to database, delete data and how to display data to my website from the database.</p>
        <h3>Question-2 : What would you do differently?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>I have created my project for the new collectors to sign up and load, update and delete their stamps information from the database so that those stamps data can be visible to all users in a user-friendly manner.</p>
        <h3>Question-3 : How the skills you learned can be applied elsewhere?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>Now I think I can do any project with PHP to make any website.</p>
        <h3>Question-4 : What was the hardest and easiest part of the project?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Answer : </b>At the beginning  when I was starting to create the project, it was the most hardest part because i didn't know how to start, where to start and most of all php is the newest language to me at that time. After I am learning about session, connecting to database.....then I was feeling that I can start and do my work step by step. Now I can easily get my data which is very pleased to me.  </p>
